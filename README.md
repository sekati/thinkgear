Description
-------------------------------------

SK Thinkgear is an AS3 framework for working with NeuroSky's Thinkgear EEG Headsets. 
Thanks to their open architecture BCI (_brain-computer interface_) devices we can 
easily read raw EEG powers data & parse algorithmic reading abstractions performed 
by the hardware.

  
Requirements

Documentation
-------------------------------------
	
Specific attention has been paid to writing thorough and concise Documentation

Notes
-------------------------------------

A note on launch profiles: most mxmlc building profiles are best run from Eclipse
with FDT (_v3 or v4_) or Flex/FlashBuilder via the Eclipse menu:

`Run->Debug Configuration` FDT menu, however the ASDoc profile should be
launched from `Run->External Tools->External Tools Configuration...` menu &
similarly the Air launch profile needs to be run from the 
`Run->Run Configurations` menu.
